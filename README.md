#**Personal Project**
======================

##**Website using Bootstrap**
The purpose of this project is to utilize the skills learned on HTML5 and CSS3 to then apply them into Bootstrap.
I created a simple three page personal website using a template available from getbootstrap.com; I made some modifications 
to it and added meaningful content about myself. This website can easily be viewed on any mobile device or pc, and can be the base for my official website if I ever happen to make one.
